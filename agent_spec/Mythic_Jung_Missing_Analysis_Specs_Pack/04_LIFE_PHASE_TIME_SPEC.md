# 04 — Life Phase / Time Context Spec

## Purpose
Model **where the user is in their life myth**, not just who they are.

This prevents static identity traps.

## Where it appears
- Story tab (new section): **Current Chapter**
- Functioning tab: Narrative Arc framing

## Life phases (simplified)
- Initiation (learning, proving)
- Ascent (building, conquering)
- Maintenance (holding complexity)
- Integration (meaning, synthesis)
- Reorientation (letting go, re-choosing)

## Generation rules
- Infer phase from:
  - character constellation
  - fatigue signals
  - individuation direction
- Never label as permanent.
- Frame as *chapter*, not destiny.

## Output requirements
- Name current chapter
- Describe:
  - what no longer works
  - what must be preserved
  - what is now central

## Evidence
- Reference Individuation Direction + Cost & Compensation.
