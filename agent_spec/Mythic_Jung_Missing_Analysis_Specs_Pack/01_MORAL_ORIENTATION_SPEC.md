# 01 — Moral Orientation / Truth Axis Spec

## Purpose
Model **how the user decides what is true and right when rules, authority, or consensus fail**.

This is NOT values-in-general.
It is a *decision rule* under moral pressure.

## Where it appears
- Identification tab (new card): **Truth Orientation**
- Story tab (implicit): Central Tension framing
- Life Domains: Truth & Rules

## Core dimensions to model
- Truth source:
  - empirical / reality-based
  - relational / loyalty-based
  - systemic / institutional
  - compassionate / care-based
- Obedience threshold:
  - high (prefers rules)
  - conditional (rules must make sense)
  - low (truth overrides rules)
- Moral loneliness tolerance:
  - low (needs consensus)
  - medium
  - high (can stand alone)

## Generation rules
- Infer baseline from characters (Rick, House, Hunt etc).
- Strengthen or soften using:
  - Shadow Virtue answers
  - Truth-related Life Domain answers
- Avoid framing as rebellion.
- Frame as *epistemic integrity*.

## Output requirements
- 1–2 paragraph explanation
- Explicit statement:
  “When rules contradict reality, you tend to ___.”
- Include cost:
  “This can isolate you from ___.”

## Evidence
- Must reference:
  - characterRefs
  - SHD_Q4_SHADOW_VIRTUE (if answered)
