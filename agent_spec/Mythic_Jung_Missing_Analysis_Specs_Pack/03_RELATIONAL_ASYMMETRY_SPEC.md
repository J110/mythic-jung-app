# 03 — Relational Asymmetry / Mutuality Spec

## Purpose
Model **inequality of closeness and vulnerability** in relationships.

This is NOT attachment theory labeling.
It is lived relational structure.

## Where it appears
- Identification tab (under Feeling Function / Eros)
- Life Domains: Relationships & Intimacy

## Core dimensions
- Vulnerability balance:
  - mutual
  - user-gives-more
  - user-receives-more
- Emotional visibility:
  - seen
  - partially seen
  - largely unseen
- Independence pressure:
  - low
  - medium
  - high

## Generation rules
- Infer from:
  - hyper-independence patterns
  - intimacy blockers
  - compensators
- Explicitly normalize asymmetry (not pathology).
- Emphasize *conditions for mutuality*, not “fixing”.

## Output requirements
- Statement:
  “You often give more ___ than you receive.”
- Statement:
  “Intimacy stabilizes you, but also costs ___.”
- Guidance:
  “Mutuality increases when ___.”

## Evidence
- Reference Feeling Function + Cost & Compensation.
