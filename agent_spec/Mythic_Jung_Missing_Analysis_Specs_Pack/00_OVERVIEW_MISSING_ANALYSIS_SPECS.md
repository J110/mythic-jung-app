# Missing Analysis Dimensions — Agent Spec Pack

This pack adds the **four missing analytical dimensions** identified in the audit:
1. Moral Orientation / Truth Axis
2. Authority & Power Relationship
3. Relational Asymmetry / Mutuality
4. Time & Life Phase Context

These are NOT new features.
They are **analytical lenses** that must be integrated into:
- generation logic
- output schema usage
- assessment logic (lightweight)
- presentation in Story, Functioning, and Life Domains

This pack tells the agent exactly how to add them without breaking the existing system.
